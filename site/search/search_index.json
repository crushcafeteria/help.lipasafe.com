It helps make transactions more secure by keeping the payment in a secure escrow account which is only released when all of the terms of an agreement are satisfied.\n\n\n\n\nAn Real World Example\n\n\nLet us see a real-life example of escrow at work.\n\n\nNjoki visits an ad-listing website seeking to purchase a used laptop. To understand how risky this purchase can be, lets analyze Njoki's next steps:-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe does not know the actual condition of the used laptop\n\n\nShe is worried the laptop might be stolen property (very very bad)\n\n\nShe has no way of returning the product in case it is defective\n\n\nIt is unsafe to carry large amounts of money to a stranger's meeting\n\n\nShe cannot warn other buyers in case the seller is dishonest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe  then notices the seller can accept escrow payments, so she sets up an escrow transaction, orders the laptop and requests for delivery to her residence. Upon delivery of the laptop, she unboxes it, inspects its condition and specifications before authorizing payment to the seller.

Buyers can confidently purchase items from Internet vendors with minimal risk.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Contact the seller\n\n\n\n\nThe buyer makes contact with the seller and confirms the product/service can be supplied and the seller can accept LipaSafe transactions.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Start a transaction\n\n\n\n\nThe buyer will start a LipaSafe transaction by entering essential details about the deal. \n\n\nOn saving the transaction, an escrow account will be created to facilitate the transaction between the buyer and the seller. \n\n\nThe buyer can deposit into the escrow account with M-PESA as soon as the seller accepts the transaction/deal.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Alert seller\n\n\n\n\nLipaSafe will notify the seller of the buyer's intent to purchase. The seller will review the transaction to make sure it matches the verbal agreement.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Accept deal\n\n\n\n\nIf the transaction matches the verbal agreement, the seller will login to their LipaSafe account and accept the buyer's transaction/deal.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5 \n 6: Deposit funds\n\n\n\n\nOnce the seller accepts the deal, the buyer will be notified to deposit the agreed amount into the transaction account with Lipa na M-PESA.\n\n\nThe buyer will deposit the agreed amount into the transaction using Lipa Na M-PESA.

Once inspection is passed, the buyer will authorize payment to be made to the seller's M-PESA number.\n\n\n\n\nStep 10: Release funds\n\n\n\n\nLipaSafe will release the locked funds to the seller via M-PESA. \n\n\n\n\nStep 11: Review process\n\n\n\n\nAfter each transaction, both the buyer and seller have to review the completed transaction.
