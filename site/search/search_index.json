It helps make transactions more secure by keeping the payment in a secure escrow account which is only released when all of the terms of an agreement are satisfied.\n\n\n\n\nAn Real World Example\n\n\nLet us see a real-life example of escrow at work.\n\n\nNjoki visits an ad-listing website seeking to purchase a used laptop. To understand how risky this purchase can be, lets analyze Njoki's next steps:-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe does not know the actual condition of the used laptop\n\n\nShe is worried the laptop might be stolen property (very very bad)\n\n\nShe has no way of returning the product in case it is defective\n\n\nIt is unsafe to carry large amounts of money to a stranger's meeting\n\n\nShe cannot warn other buyers in case the seller is dishonest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe  then notices the seller can accept escrow payments, so she sets up an escrow transaction, orders the laptop and requests for delivery to her residence. Upon delivery of the laptop, she unboxes it, inspects its condition and specifications before authorizing payment to the seller.
