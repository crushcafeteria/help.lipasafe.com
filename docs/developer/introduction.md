# What is the Escrow Developer API (EDA)?

The Escrow Developer API is a collection of resources, techniques and endpoints created to help 
you as a developer integrate secure escrow payment services into your web applications. 

Developers can integrate the safety and security of Lipasafe payments into their platform simply. 
Our approach is similar to integrating other common payment services like adding Stripe or Paypal. 
We have engineered our API to let you spend more time running your business and less time worrying 
about processing payments or staying compliant. 

## What methods are available?
