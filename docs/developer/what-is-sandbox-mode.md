# What is Sandbox Mode?

A sandbox is a test environment used to facilitate development of an integration.
When you create a new **Vendor**, it will automatically enter **Sandbox Mode**. 

When your Vendor is in Sandbox Mode, the following rules are applied:-

1. When testing your integration, you shall not receive SMS notifications. Dev processes are very repetitive and it is not economical dispatch SMSes every time a test happens. We will include enabling Sandbox SMS in the future.
2. We shall send all email notifications to the email address provided in your vendor registration (Vendor Email field). This will make it easy for you to track emails sent by Lipasafe.
