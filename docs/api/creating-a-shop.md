# Registering your LipaSafe shop

Integrating LipaSafe into your website, requires you to register a shop in the [LipaSafe Developer Centre](https://lipasafe.com/developer/home). A  shop contains a configuration which LipaSafe will use to handle transactions from your website.

To create a shop, follow the following instructions:-

1. Login to your LipaSafe account
2. Click on **Developer Centre** in the dropdown at the top right corner of your screen
3. Click on **Create a shop**
4. Enter your shop details in the form accurately.
5. Click on **Create this shop**.

!!! hint "Hibernation Mode"
    By default, a new shop is turned off by default. We call this **Hibernation Mode**. When a shop is hibernating, it will not accept any transactions from customers. To activate it, you MUST click the **Turn On** button on the right side of the listed item.
