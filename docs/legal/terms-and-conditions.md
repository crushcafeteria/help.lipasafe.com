Each User agrees to indemnify and hold Lipasafe.com harmless for losses resulting from any use or attempted use of the Services in violation of this Agreement.

Rejection of Payment - Since the use of a bank account, credit card or debit card account, or the making of an electronic funds transfer may be limited by your agreement with your financial institution and/or by applicable law, Lipasafe.com is not liable to any User if Lipasafe.com does not complete a Transaction as a result of any such limit, or if a financial institution fails to honor any credit or debit to or from an Account. Lipasafe.com may post operating rules related to payment on the Site and change such rules from time to time.

General Conditions of Use - If you arrive at the Site through entities linked and/or integrated with Lipasafe.com or otherwise by or through a third party (e.g., an auction, exchange, or Internet-based intermediary that hosts electronic marketplaces and mediates transactions among businesses), then you authorize such third party to transfer relevant data to Lipasafe.com to facilitate the Transaction. You represent and warrant that all information you provide to Lipasafe.com or to such third party will be true, accurate and complete. The party entering into this Agreement on behalf of any User represents and warrants that he/she is authorized to do so and to bind the User and is a natural person of at least eighteen (18) years of age. In order to initiate and commence a Transaction, all Users to a Transaction must register at the Site, agree to all terms in the General Escrow Instructions and agree to the Transaction Escrow Instructions.

Obligations of Sellers - On the Transaction Detail Screens, each Seller to a Transaction must designate an Account to which payment for the Transaction will be made. Each Seller authorizes IES and its authorized agents to initiate credit entries to such Seller's Account for payment of the purchase price, or applicable balance due, and to debit Seller's Account to discharge Seller's obligations. Each Seller in a Transaction shall deliver the items set forth in Transaction Detail Screens directly to the Buyer (or Buyers), at the address specified by such Buyer as shown on the Lipasafe.com website and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Transaction Escrow Instructions and General Escrow Instructions. Seller shall use a delivery service that provides a confirmation of delivery and Seller shall provide Lipasafe.com with a tracking or reference number for the shipment of the goods. Seller gives Lipasafe.com permission to act as its agent in communicating with the shipping company regarding the notice of the delivery of the goods. In the event Lipasafe.com does not receive notice of shipment from Seller within ten (10) calendar days of notification from Lipasafe.com's notice to Seller to ship the items, Seller authorizes Lipasafe.com to return the escrowed funds (excluding Lipasafe.com fees) to Buyer. In the event of a return of the items by Buyer, Seller shall notify Lipasafe.com of the receipt of the returned items. Upon receipt of such notice from Seller, the Seller's five (5) day inspection period shall commence. In the event Seller accepts the returned items within the inspection period or fails to act within the inspection period, Lipasafe.com shall remit the escrowed funds (excluding Lipasafe.com fees) to Buyer. If Seller notifies Lipasafe.com of its non-acceptance of any returned items within the Seller's inspection period, then Lipasafe.com will retain the escrow funds pending resolution of the dispute or take other action as authorized. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, if all Users to a Transaction agree on the Transaction Detail Screens that there is no shipping required, then no party hereto will have any obligation under this Agreement with respect to shipping.

Obligations of Buyers - On the Transaction Detail Screens, Buyer must designate a payment mechanism and an Account from which the purchase price and related fees (unless such fees are to be paid by Seller) will be obtained for the deposit into escrow. Depending on the amount of the Transaction and the currency selected for the Transaction, Buyer may remit the necessary funds via various methods, which may include corporate credit card, charge card, debit card or purchasing card, check (cheque), cashier's check, money order, ACH Debit or Wire Transfer. In the case of wire transfers, Buyer will initiate the wire to an account designated by Lipasafe.com on or before the date set forth in the Transaction Detail Screens. Regardless of the payment method, Buyer authorizes Lipasafe.com and Lipasafe.com authorized agents to initiate credit or debit transactions, as applicable, to obtain the purchase price and fees due for a Transaction and to initiate any debit or credit entries or reversals, as the case may be, as may be necessary to correct any error in a payment or transfer and to discharge Buyer's obligations under Section 22 of this Agreement. Lipasafe.com will deposit funds received from Buyer into an escrow trust account maintained by Lipasafe.com (the "Escrow Account"). Unless otherwise requested as specified in the following sentence, escrowed deposits do not earn interest for Buyer or Seller. If you anticipate an extended closing of the Transaction, then you may request and approve an instruction to have Lipasafe.com place Buyer's funds into an interest bearing account for the benefit of Buyer or Seller. If interest is to accrue to the benefit of the Seller, then both Buyer and Seller must request and approve the establishment of the interest bearing account. If this request is made, then Lipasafe.com will charge the account of the party to whom the interest accrues an additional nonrefundable service charge of $100.00, which must be paid in advance. Buyer shall notify Lipasafe.com of the receipt or non-receipt of the items on the date the merchandise is received or the Buyer Inspection Period is started. Buyer shall notify Lipasafe.com of the Buyer's acceptance or rejection of the items before the Buyer's Inspection Period expires. Upon receipt of notice from Buyer that the items have been received and accepted, Lipasafe.com shall transfer the payment amount (less any amount payable to Lipasafe.com for Lipasafe.com fees) to Seller's Account. Transfer to a Seller generally will be initiated within the next business day from the day on which notice of acceptance of the items is received from the Buyer. If Buyer has not notified Lipasafe.com of the non-receipt or rejection of the items during the Buyer's Inspection Period, then Buyer authorizes Lipasafe.com to remit the escrowed funds (excluding Lipasafe.com fees) to the Seller. Buyer shall follow the procedures set forth on the Site in the event the items are rejected.

Obligations of Brokers - On the Transaction Detail Screens, each Broker to a Transaction must designate an Account to which the Broker Fee payment will be made. Each Broker authorizes IES and its authorized agents to initiate credit entries to such Broker's Account for payment of the Broker's commission, and to debit Broker's account to discharge Broker's obligations. Each Broker in a Transaction shall provide Buyer email, Seller email, and Transaction details including purchase price, merchandise description, inspection period and which party is responsible for the Broker and Escrow fees.

Lipasafe.com shall not be liable for any error in judgment, for any act taken or not taken, or for any mistake of fact or law, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct (subject to the limitations in Section 17 below).
