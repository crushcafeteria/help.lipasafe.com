## What is Lipasafe.com?
Lipasafe.com is a secure escrow payment service that reduces your risk of getting defrauded online 
by acting as a trusted third party that accepts, holds and executes payment on deals.

## What does “Escrow” mean?
An escrow is a financial and legal agreement designed to protect a buyer and seller in a transaction. 
For a small fee, a trusted and independent third party holds payment until everyone fulfills their 
responsibilities in the transaction.

With an escrow payment, the Seller will only receive the funds when the Buyer has received and accepted 
the products and/or services that are specified in the transaction. The Seller knows that they will 
receive payment because Lipasafe.com is holding the funds on their behalf. Using an escrow transaction 
ensures the buyer gets a quality product / service and the seller gets paid.

## When to Use an Escrow Service
Many people use an escrow service to acquire high-value goods / services, especially when they don’t 
know each other. Lipasafe.com protects the Buyer and Seller equally, thereby eliminating any risk of 
fraud by conducting business with unknown parties.

No matter where you’re selling or buying goods and services online, whether an auction site, an online 
marketplace, or a B2B e-commerce site, an escrow service will assure your money / product’s safety.
