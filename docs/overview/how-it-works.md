# How does LipaSafe work?
Lipasafe.com reduces the risk of fraud by acting as a trusted third-party that collects, holds, and only disburses funds when both the Buyer and Seller are satisfied with the transaction. The following steps describe a Lipasafe.com transaction:-

* Buyer and seller agree to terms. Either the Buyer or Seller initiates a transaction on Lipasafe. After registering, all parties MUST agree to the terms of the transaction before it can move forward.
* Buyer deposits funds to Lipasafe. The Buyer submits a payment using the approved payment methods into the transaction account. Lipasafe.com verifies the deposit, then the Seller is notified that funds have been secured “In Escrow”.
* Seller delivers product/service to Buyer. Upon payment verification, Lipasafe.com will authorize the Seller to deliver the merchandise to the buyer. Lipasafe.com verifies that the Buyer has received the goods or services.
* Buyer accepts product / service. The Buyer has a set number of days (Inspection Period) to inspect the product / service with the option to accept or reject it. If the product / service is of low quality, the Buyer has the option to reject the transaction and enter the dispute resolution process.
* Lipasafe.com pays the Seller. If the product/service is of good quality, the Buyer will pay the Seller promptly. Lipasafe.com will release the funds to the Seller from the Escrow Account.

Here is a complete flow of the Lipasafe.com process:-

## What happens if a buyer or seller rejects the transaction?
Both the buyer and seller have the right to reject a transaction for any valid reason. In case a transaction is rejected, it automatically enters the Dispute Resolution Process which works as follows:-

* Buyer will return the product / service to the seller at their own cost and provide proof of returning the product / service
* The seller will confirm receiving the return and provide proof of the same.
* Lipasafe.com will cross check and refund the buyer the transaction amount less service fees.

## What is the Inspection Period?
The Inspection Period is the number of days it will take to check the product / service or perform due diligence. This period is usually specified at the start of the transaction and **MUST** be agreed upon beforehand by both the buyer and seller.

## What if the buyer receives the product / service and refuses to pay the seller?
Lipasafe.com will automatically release the secured funds to the seller after expiry of the Inspection Period.
