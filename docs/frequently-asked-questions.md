## How does online escrow work?
Online escrow is a five-step payment process that protects Buyers and Sellers in a transaction. Lipasafe.com holds the funds in trust while goods and/or services are delivered from Seller to the Buyer. Lipasafe.com only releases the funds once the Buyer has received and accepted the goods and/or services. To view more information about Lipasafe.com’s process, [click here](/overview/how-it-works).

## How do I check the status of my transactions?
To check the status of your transaction, you simply sign into your Lipasafe.com account. After signing in, you can access your transaction view page to see the progress of your Lipasafe.com transactions.

## How do I change transaction details and terms?
Changes can be made on the “Transaction View Page” after signing onto Lipasafe.com when the status is “NOT ACCEPTED”.

If you are waiting for the other party to agree, only that party has access to the "EDIT" button. Once both parties have agreed to the terms, the transaction cannot be modified.

The following are options available to modify:

## How do Buyers or Sellers cancel transactions?
Prior to the agreement of terms by both parties, the Buyer or Seller can cancel the transaction by clicking the “Cancel” button on the transaction detail screen.

After both parties have confirmed transaction details in the Agreement phase, either party may cancel the transaction, if Lipasafe.com has not received the Buyer's funds, by sending an email request to care@lipasafe.com.

After funds are secured, the cancellation of a transaction can only be done by Lipasafe.com after notification of both parties.

## If I have any questions about the product, do I contact Lipasafe.com?
We highly recommend all Buyers reach out directly to their Sellers to find out more about the products and/or services being exchanged in their transactions. It is critical for both parties to agree upon the precise description of that being sold or rendered. If there are any questions about any element of the transaction, this should be clarified at the commencement of any transaction.

The product should be clearly defined in the “Description” section of the transaction, and both the Buyer and Seller must agree on all aspects of the transaction, including the “Description” section at the inception of a transaction.

Additionally, once the Buyer receives the products and/or services, the Inspection Period becomes critical to ensure the products and/or services are exactly those listed in the “Description” or agreement. If the product and/or service is not what was agreed upon at the inception of the transaction, the Buyer has the opportunity to return or reject the products and/or services before the Inspection Period expires.
