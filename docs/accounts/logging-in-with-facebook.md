??? question "Why am I being asked to fill the profile form?"
    Sometimes, your Facebook email will be different from the email you used to register your LipaSafe account. In this situations, you will be asked to register again with the new email address. You can also login to your existing LipaSafe account and match youe email to the Facebook email.

    Yes. LipaSafe will send a verification email to your new address. Click on the link in the email to verify your account. Remeber to check the **Spam Folder** too ;-)
